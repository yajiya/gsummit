          <div><strong>Big data and precision medicine</strong> – Han Liang, Associate Professor, Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center</div>
          <div class="text-small thin">
            Recent technological advances, such as high-throughput sequencing, artificial intelligence and cloud computing, are revolutionizing clinical practice, making it possible to provide better patient care based on “big data” of patients. The major theme of this discussion is how those emerging technologies will define the opportunities and challenges for precision medicine.

          <div><strong>Mining and Modeling Large Social and Information Networks</strong> – Jure Leskovec, Chief Scientist, Pinterest</div>
          <div class="text-small thin">
            I am Associate Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University. My research focuses on mining and modeling large social and information networks, their evolution, and diffusion of information and influence over them. Problems I investigate are motivated by large scale data, the Web and on-line media.I am also Chief Scientists at Pinterest, where I am focusing on machine learning problems.

          <div><strong>Can Consumer Technologies Help Accelerate Research? Absolutely!</strong> – Sridhar Iyengar, CEO &amp; Founder, Elemental Machines</div>
          <div class="text-small thin">
            Historically, innovative technologies were deployed in businesses and vertical markets, and eventually made it to the consumer. Now that innovation flow has reversed. For example, the devices and apps that consumers take for granted in their day-to-day lives have mind-blowing technologies under their ruthlessly simple interfaces -- and many of those technologies are now flowing upstream to highly specialized vertical markets that have been underserved by these advances like synthetic biology and healthcare delivery. We will discuss this rapidly evolving innovation process from consumer to more specialized sectors and how this is creating new market opportunities.

          <div><strong>Autonomy and the Personal Transportation Revolution</strong> – Carl Dietrich, CEO/ CTO, Co-Founder Terrafugia</div>
          <div class="text-small thin">
            Autonomy will improve transportation safety and give us all more time to focus on other things -- largely ignoring the process of "getting there".  How and when will it happen?  Will the "flying car" finally arrive?  How will reality differ from the hype?

          <div><strong>Current challenges in AI and Open Source Initiatives</strong> – Larry Zitnick, AI Research Manager, Facebook</div>
          <div class="text-small thin">
            The state of the art in artificial intelligence is quickly changing. This session discusses future directions of AI, and and how open source initiatives can spur progress.

          <div><strong>A Billion Editors: AI in News</strong> – Charles Fan, CTO, Cheetah Mobile</div>
          <div class="text-small thin">
            The news industry has already been disrupted by Internet multiple times: online portals, search engines, social networks.  AI will be the next in line.  Imagine having the best editor in the world, dedicated in serving only you, 24x7, sorting through the best content, curating the best to create your personal newspaper, and delivering to your screen at every moment.  Now multiply that one billion times...

          <div><strong>Is the Longevity Economy the next Great Venture Capital Opportunity</strong> – James Hahn, President, Asia Alpha Private Equity</div>
          <div class="text-small thin">
            Life expectancies have risen from a global average of 49 in 1955 to age 72 today.  By 2040, the global population of those 65 will reach 1.3 billion, double what it is today. By 2020, the spending power of consumers aged 60 and older will hit $15 trillion globally, up from $8 trillion in 2010. USA consumers over age 55 spend twice as much as Millennials.  What’s your “50 plus strategy”?

          <div><strong>Neurocognitive Challenges of Immersive Computing</strong>  - Stefano Baldassi, Director of Analytics &amp; Neuroscience, Meta</div>
          <div class="text-small thin">
            As VR and AR are reaching technological maturity, mass awareness, and growing adoption, there is an increasing need to connect Neuro- and Cognitive-Sciences with hardware and software interface development. Digital tools are distributed in 3D space and have volumetric appearance, colocated audio, manipulability and in some cases, haptic identity. In this session we will discuss how neuroscience and spatialized digital information will synergistically scale human machine interaction and potentially improve performance in real world tasks.
