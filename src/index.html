          <p>G-Summit is not an average science conference. It is a curation of the world’s leading scientists, tech executives and investors.</p>
          <p>The mission is bold, yet the method is simple. What happens when the brightest minds in artificial intelligence, materials science and biomedicine come together from around the world to share breakthrough research and discoveries? What happens when the best from academia and industry collaborate? What happens when scientists with the capability to change the world work with investors to commercialize ideas and tech executives to distribute it globally. Amazing things happen.</p>
